INTRODUCTION
------------

This module allows you to automatize IP ban by cron using module rules.

You create rule which finds IP in watchlog table entries and then module inserts
IP to table for banned IP.
You must enable Database Logging core module and at least one
IP Ban Provider by enabling submodules.
Now this is a Autoban Core Ban and Autoban Advanced Ban
(https://www.drupal.org/project/advban).
To enable these modules you must enable or install IP ban modules
(Ban, Advanced Ban).

Rules for ban IP consist of:
- Type (watchdog type, like "page not found").
- Message pattern (rules seek in watchdog message as "LIKE %message_pattern%").
- URL referrer pattern.
- The threshold number of log entries.
- IP ban provider.
- User type (anonymous, authenticated or any).
